## Repository creation automation

User ask to create a repository with all required permissions. The bot ask for the name and then check if such repository already exists. If yes then just add the user the permissions. If repository doesn't exist creates new and apply branch policies and creates and adds user to the repository contributors. Owner i always a group (name tbd). 

Before adding the permissions a approval flow should be started.
