## Approve PAT Tokens
Sometimes the users write a question with something like this:
- Hi team, can you please approve the following tokens: token1, token2, token3.
The bot should start an approve flow to the available approver and ask if the tokens can be approved. If yes execute action and approve token, inform back the requsted user.
