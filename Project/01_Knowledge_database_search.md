## Knowledge database search

It's often that the user would just like to search our knowledge database. Coommon questions are:
- how do I use elastic in dotnet application?
- how to send sms with notification system?
- how to access swiss life github?
- how to make contribution to swiss life open source repository?
- how to start working with ui monorepository?
- search through source code (nice to have)

The bot should scan our sourcecode and wiki from sample azure dev ops instance and provide valid answer. The bot should only use external data source feedback (the thing called 'internet') if nothing is found in internal will and explicitly inform the user that the knowledge is from external data source.
